# KLE Layouts

These files are generated by modeling our keyboard layouts in [KLE](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com).
That is then exported and converted to the format for `info.json`.
But to continue editing them, I kept the files here. Might be useful for the future.

| Layout | Standard KLE Layout  | VIA KLE Layout  | VIA Design        |
| ------ | -------------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| ANSI   | `ansi_layout.json`   | `ansi_via.json` | `via_design.json` |
| ISO    | `iso_layout.json`    |                 |                   |
| JIS    | `jis_layout.json`    |                 |                   |
| Numpad | `numpad_layout.json` |                 |                   |

- The Standard KLE Layout is just downloaded from KLE.
- The VIA KLE Layout has matrix positions as labels instead of the actual key labels.
- VIA Design is the VIA KLE layout embedded in to a VIA compatible JSON file.

The VIA Design file can be imported into VIA, then it will discover the
keyboard. This should be submitted to the VIA [keyboard repository](https://github.com/the-via/keyboards).
